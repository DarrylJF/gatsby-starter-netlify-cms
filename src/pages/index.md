    - facialType: electric machines
      facialDescription: Electrical machines are known to help in reducing fine lines and
        wrinkles as well as improving skins texture and appearance. Gentle
        electrical currents can help to tighten muscles, increase collagen
        production and promote new skin cell growth. Opatra optimises
        technologies such as galvanic, ultrasonic and photon therapy to treat
        such concerns.
    - facialType: tropic products
      facialDescription: Tropic is a multi award winning, vegan and cruelty free brand which
        specialises in natural products which help to freshen, brighten and
        improve the skin’s texture and appearance. Tropic is at the forefront of
        the green beauty movement, using ingredients that promote the overall
        health of our skin.
